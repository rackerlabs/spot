Our public roadmap allows you to see what we're working on, what stage of readiness features are in, and when you can expect to receive new features.  Please help improve our roadmap by suggesting enhancements by filing an issue.
    
## Roadmap swimlanes

Our roadmap is organized into swimlanes as below:

-   **Shipped:** 
    Features that have been shipped and made available in Spot.
    
-   **Coming Soon:** 
    Features that will become available in the next update to Spot.  Spot is generally updated with new features every 4-6 weeks.
    
-   **Work In Progress:** 
    Work is actively underway but hasn't progressed enough to definitely catch the next update.

-   **Next quarter** 
    Features that are high on our radar but aren't actively being worked on, and may get done in the medium term (2-4 months).
    
-   **Backlog** 
    Features and requests that may be exploratory, or haven't been targeted to a specific timeframe.  These are included in the roadmap for your visibility and feedback.
